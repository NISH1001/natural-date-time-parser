# natural-date-time-parser
A very noob implementation of processing date-time that is nore natural.

--------------------

## The probable use case
Say current date is `July 3, 2017`.
```bash
sentence = "I have a meeting tomorrow."
```

So, what it will give (if project is completed):
```bash
meeting July 4, 2017
```
